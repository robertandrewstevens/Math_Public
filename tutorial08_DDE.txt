Delay Differential Equations

What?

Delay Differential Equations are similar to ODEs except that they involve past values of variables and/or derivatives.

DDEs in R: R-package deSolve

- dede solves DDEs

- lagvalue provides lagged values of the state variables

- lagderiv provides lagged values of the derivatives

Example: Chaotic Production of White Blood Cells 

Mackey-Glass Equation:

- y: current density of white blood cells,

- yτ is the density τ time-units in the past, 

- first term equation is production rate

- b is destruction rate

y′ = (ayτ)/(1 + yτ^c) − by

yτ = y(t − τ)

yt = 0.5 for t ≤ 0

- For τ = 10 the output is periodic,

- For τ = 20 cell densities display a chaotic pattern

Solution in R

> library(deSolve)
> retarded <- function(t, y, parms, tau) {
  tlag <- t - tau 
  if (tlag <= 0) 
    ylag <- 0.5
  else
    ylag <- lagvalue(tlag)
  dy <- 0.2*ylag*1/(1+ylag^10) - 0.1*y 
  list(dy = dy, ylag = ylag)
}
> yinit <- 0.5
> times <- seq(from = 0, to = 300, by = 0.1)
> yout1 <- dede(y = yinit, times = times, func = retarded, parms = NULL, tau = 10) 
> yout2 <- dede(y = yinit, times = times, func = retarded, parms = NULL, tau = 20)

Solution in R

> plot(yout1, lwd = 2, main = "tau=10", ylab = "y", mfrow = c(2, 2), which = 1) 
> plot(yout1[,-1], type = "l", lwd = 2, xlab = "y")
> plot(yout2, lwd = 2, main = "tau=20", ylab = "y", mfrow = NULL, which = 1)
> plot(yout2[,-1], type = "l", lwd = 2, xlab = "y")

Exercise: the Lemming model

A nice variant of the logistic model is the DDE lemming model:

y′ =r·y(1 − y(t − τ)/K)

Use file examples/ddelemming.R.txt as a template to implement this model

- initial condition y(t = 0) = 19.001

- parameter values r = 3.5, τ = 0.74, K = 19 

- history y(t) = 19 for t < 0

- Generate output for t in [0, 40].
