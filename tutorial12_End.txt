A lot of effort went in creating this software; please cite it when using it.
􏰳 deSolve: [22], rootSolve [21], ReacTran [18],
􏰳 Some complex examples can be found in [20],
􏰳 A framework to fit differential equation models to data is FME [19],
􏰳 . . . and don’t forget the authors of the original algorithms [5, 10, 2]!
Acknowledgments
􏰳 None of this would be possible without the splendid work of the R Core Team [11],
􏰳 This presentation was created with Sweave [8],
􏰳 Creation of the packages made use of R-Forge [23].
